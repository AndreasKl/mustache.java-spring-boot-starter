# A spring boot starter for mustache.java

Exchanges the default mustache engine used by spring boot https://github.com/samskivert/jmustache with https://github.com/spullara/mustache.java

Both engines are implemented in plain java without external dependencies.
While extending *mustache.java* and *jmustache* with the same features, I found extending
*mustache.java* was pretty simple whereas the code base of *jmustache* was not on the same level.
